idk you could have just used your os's settings but I guess you are as lazy as me.

Installing dependencies:

1. Python3: Install from python.org or just do sudo apt-get install python if you're on linux.

2. Pyautogui module: Do "pip install pyautogui"

How to run it:

1. For linux users: Do "python3 {path to the python file}"

2. For windows users: Click on it bro lol or do "python {path to file}" on your CMD
